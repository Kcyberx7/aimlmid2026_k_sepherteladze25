Pearson Correlation Analysis and Visualization
The data points used in this analysis were extracted manually from the provided online graph. By hovering the mouse over each blue data point, the corresponding (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) coordinates were displayed on the screen and recorded. 
After collecting the data, a Python script was developed to calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient and visualize the relationship between the two variables. The NumPy library was used to store the extracted coordinates in arrays and to compute Pearson’s correlation coefficient using the standard correlation formula. This coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the variables.
To support the numerical result, the Matplotlib library was used to generate a scatter plot of the data points. The scatter plot provides a visual confirmation of the linear relationship observed in the numerical analysis.
After executing the code, the resulting graph was successfully generated, showing a clear upward linear trend. The calculated Pearson correlation coefficient was approximately (real meaning r=0.9991781943735769) r=1.00, indicating a very strong positive linear correlation between the variables.
